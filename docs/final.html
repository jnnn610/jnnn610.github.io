    Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1985), known professionally as Lana Del Rey, is an American singer-songwriter. Her music is noted for its <b>cinematic quality and exploration of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia</b> , containing references to contemporary pop culture, as well as 1950s and 1960s Americana.
    <br><br>
Del Rey was born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant on June 21, 1985, in Manhattan, New York City, to Robert England Grant Jr.She has a younger sister, Caroline, and a younger brother, Charlie.She was raised Roman Catholic and is of Scottish descent. When she was one year old, the family moved to Lake Placid, New York. In Lake Placid, her father worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor; her mother worked as a schoolteacher. There, she attended St. Agnes School in her elementary years and began singing in her church choir.
<br><br>
She attended the high school where her mother taught for one year, but when she was 15 her parents sent her to Kent School to resolve a budding drinking problem.Her uncle, an admissions officer at the school, secured her financial aid to attend. According to Grant, she had trouble making friends during much of her teenage and early adult years.She has said she was preoccupied with death from a young age.
<br><br>
After graduating from the Kent School, she spent a year living on Long Island with her aunt and uncle and working as a waitress. During this time, Grant's uncle taught her to play guitar, and she realized that she could probably <b>write a million songs with those six chords.</b>Shortly after, she began writing songs and performing in nightclubs around the city under various names such as "Sparkle Jump Rope Queen" and "Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena". "I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously", she said. "When I got to New York City when I was eighteen, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn—I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point—and that was it.
