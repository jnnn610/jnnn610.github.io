	Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1985), known professionally as Lana Del Rey, is an American singer-songwriter. Her music is noted for its <b>cinematic quality and exploration of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia</b> , containing references to contemporary pop culture, as well as 1950s and 1960s Americana.
	<br><br>
Del Rey was born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant on June 21, 1985, in Manhattan, New York City, to Robert England Grant Jr.She has a younger sister, Caroline, and a younger brother, Charlie.She was raised Roman Catholic and is of Scottish descent. When she was one year old, the family moved to Lake Placid, New York. In Lake Placid, her father worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor; her mother worked as a schoolteacher. There, she attended St. Agnes School in her elementary years and began singing in her church choir.
<br><br>
She attended the high school where her mother taught for one year, but when she was 15 her parents sent her to Kent School to resolve a budding drinking problem.Her uncle, an admissions officer at the school, secured her financial aid to attend. According to Grant, she had trouble making friends during much of her teenage and early adult years.She has said she was preoccupied with death from a young age.
<br><br>
After graduating from the Kent School, she spent a year living on Long Island with her aunt and uncle and working as a waitress. During this time, Grant's uncle taught her to play guitar, and she realized that she could probably <b>write a million songs with those six chords.</b>Shortly after, she began writing songs and performing in nightclubs around the city under various names such as "Sparkle Jump Rope Queen" and "Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena". "I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously", she said. "When I got to New York City when I was eighteen, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn—I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point—and that was it.

I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba—Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue. The name was also inspired by actress Lana Turner and the Ford Del Rey sedan, produced and sold in Brazil in the 1980s. Initially she used the alternate spelling Lana Del Ray, the name under which her self-titled debut album was released in January 2010.</p>

	<h3>Musical style</h3>
	<p>Upon her debut release, Del Rey's music was described as <b>"Hollywood sadcore"</b> by some music critics. It has been repeatedly noted for its <b>cinematic soundcinematic sound</b> and its references to various aspects of pop culture; both critics and Del Rey herself have noted a persistent theme of <b>1950s and 1960s Americana</b>. The strong elements of American nostalgia brought Idolator to classify her firmly as alternative pop. Del Rey elaborated on her connection to the past in an interview with Artistdirect, saying <i>"I wasn't even born in the '50s but I feel like I was there."</i>
Del Rey is generally regarded as an alternative pop singer. Her works have been categorized as pop, rock, dream pop, baroque pop,indie pop, psychedelic rock, while incorporating trip hop, hip hop, lo-fi, and trap elements. Of Born to Die, indie music journal Drowned in Sound wrote, "She likes that whole hip hop thing though, has this whole swagger thing going that not many girls like her got", adding that it sounded like a poppier Bond soundtrack.

Del Rey's subsequent releases would introduce variant styles, particularly Ultraviolence, which employed a <b>guitar-based sound akin to psychedelic and desert rock</b>. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard noted this shift in style, writing: "She sings about drugs, cars, money, and the bad boys she's always falling for, and while there remains a sepia-toned mid-century flavor to many of these songs, Del Rey is no longer fronting like a thugged-out Bette Davis.Upon the release of Honeymoon, one reviewer characterized Del Rey's body of work as being "about music as a time warp, with her languorous croons over molasses-like arrangements meant to make clock hands seem to move so slowly that it feels possible, at times, they might go backwards.</p>
<h3>Voice and timbre</h3>
<p>Del Rey possesses an <b>expansive contralto vocal range</b>, which spans three-plus octaves and has been described as captivating and highly emotive, ranging from high notes in a girlish timbre to jazzy ornaments in her lower gesture with great ease.Following the release of Ultraviolence, which was recorded live in single takes and lacking Pro Tools vocal editing, critics fell into favor with Del Rey's vocal ability, praising her large range, increased vocal confidence, and uniquely emotive delivery.When recording in the studio Del Rey is known for <b>vocal multi-layering</b>, which, as it has been noted, is difficult for her to replicate within a live setting, especially with the lack of backing singers to fill out the original vocal style. Stage fright has also been noted as a major contribution to Del Rey's struggles with live performances.However, journalists noted in 2014 that her live performances had increased in confidence. Billboard deemed the Coachella debut of "West Coast" to be a "star-making performance" and lauded the singer's vocal abilities. Contemporary music critics have called her voice "smoky","gravelly", and reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe.</p>
